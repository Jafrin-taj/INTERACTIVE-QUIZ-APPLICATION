##THE CREATION OF THIS PROJECT WAS A STEP-BY-STEP LEARNING PROCESS. IT WAS DEVELOPED USING THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM CLASS LECTURES, FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT NOTEBOOKS, AND PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AVAILABLE THROUGH YOUTUBE VIDEOS. INITIALLY, THE STRUCTURE AND BEHAVIOR OF A BASIC HTML PAGE WERE UNDERSTOOD. THEN, THROUGH STUDYING TUTORIALS AND CLASS EXAMPLES, I LEARNED HOW TO USE CSS FOR STYLING AND JAVASCRIPT FOR DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR.

THIS PROJECT IS A FULLY FUNCTIONAL, BROWSER-BASED QUIZ APPLICATION BUILT USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE USERS WITH AN INTERACTIVE PLATFORM TO TEST THEIR KNOWLEDGE ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS THROUGH MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS. THE APPLICATION DISPLAYS QUESTIONS ONE BY ONE, GIVES INSTANT FEEDBACK ON ANSWERS, TRACKS THE SCORE DYNAMICALLY, AND ALLOWS THE USER TO RESTART THE QUIZ UPON COMPLETION. IT IS A SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE DEMONSTRATION OF HOW FRONT-END TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE USED TO BUILD USER-INTERACTIVE TOOLS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A BACKEND.
